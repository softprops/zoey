## initial release

This is the first release of async client interface for [apache zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/). Users of Twitter util's zk-client library may
find zoey's interface familiar as it was the initial inspiration for its design.

This library has a stronger preference towards leveraging many of the scala library interfaces to make it more interoperable with what you already have on your Scala classpath.

See the project's [readme](https://github.com/softprops/zoey#readme) for a more in-depth overview.
