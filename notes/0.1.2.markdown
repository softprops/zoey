## fixes

* `zoey-test` artifact is now a test dependency of `zoey-core` (as it was previously intended to be)

## enhancements

* More forgiving path appending functions.
* You can now `monitor` changes applied to a given operation. The difference between `montioring` and `watching` for changes
is that monitoring doesn't require a re-registration.
